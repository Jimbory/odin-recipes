    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packets of instant pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 cookie dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating. The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture. Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
        <li>5 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>30 buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sliced scallions, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

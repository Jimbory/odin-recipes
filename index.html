    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With more than 15,000 5-star reviews, this fan-favorite lasagna has to top the list. The consensus among reviewers: While this recipe does take over two hours to make, this lasagna tastes like it's from an Italian restaurant, even for first-time cooks. Calling it the world's best may be a little bold, but it certainly is best lasagna.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage        </li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer, more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packets of instant pudding mix</li>
        <li>1 cookie dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sift together flour and baking soda in a medium bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl. Beat in instant pudding mix until blended. Stir in eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture to the butter mixture until it's well incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.</li>
        <li>Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating. The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture. Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, divided</li>
        <li>5 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>30 buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sliced scallions, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir together cream of chicken soup, cottage cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, Creole seasoning, onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder in a medium bowl until well blended and smooth. Fold in chicken, chopped onion, and parsley until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Stir together crackers, melted butter, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Spoon chicken mixture evenly into an 11x7-inch or 9-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella then cracker mixture.</li>
        <li>Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until crackers are golden brown and edges are bubbly, about 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving; garnish with scallions if desired.</li>
